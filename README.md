## What Is YukiOS?
YukiOS is a custom OS based on Windows 11 24H2

## About
One of the main reasons I made this repository is that I'm 100% transparent about exactly what my custom OS runs during the post-install process since it is a customs OS, people could potentially hide keyloggers and malware within them. Another reason I made this is to make my life easier by having somewhere where I can easily pull files (ex. power plan) during the post-install. Having somewhere I can get the necessary files allows me to create a more compact installation, which is a plus.
